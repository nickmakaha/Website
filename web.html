  <div class="aboutheader">A Bit About Me
  <p class ="aboutpar">I'm currently pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering at UCLA, where <br> I've been fortunate enough to have had a variety of amazing experiences.
    <br> <br>
    I've always had a passion for breaking things  
    and developing creative solutions <br>  to modern day problems utilizing Computer Science.
    I've taken  <br> these passions to my work as both a student and a researcher/software engineer. <br> 
    During my first year I worked on quantum computing (a field in which many topics<br> still go right over my head). The summer after, I interned at the Department of Defense, <br>
 where I grew my actual skills as a software engineer.    I have also secured an NSF/Intel funded <br> position for this summer, where I will be researching  
    NDC (Near-Data-Computing)<br> and exploring novel methodologies for handling instructions at the lowest level. <br>
   
     <br> 
     <br> 
     I came into UCLA in a unique situation, as I had finished high school at the age of fifteen <br> 
     and had graduated from community college by the age of seventeen. This blessing has <br> 
     allowed me to move along my studies at a slower pace, taking fewer classes <br> 
     and gaining the opportunity to participate in a variety of amazing research and learn <br>
      from great minds in the field of Computer Science. I strongly believe <br> 
      that the greatest learning occurs outside of the classroom, and my choices during my <br> 
      time at UCLA have allowed me to live out this ideology.

        <p id = "work1sub">PolyArch is a computer architecture lab at UCLA focusing on developing novel ISAs, accelerator architectures and their compilers, accelerator design-automation techniques, and developing open-source architecture design frameworks.

        <button class="collapsible">More about my work at PolyArch</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>My main project as part of PolyArch is to implement a conditional step instruction in a simulated Gem5 MicroSuite. In my preliminary work, I wrote Python scripts to generate matrices of varying sparsities. I then utilized a modified version of GAP to benchmark a ternary and a branching implementation of a dot product on said sparse matrices. This showed feasibiility of a conditional step showing significant performance increases when compared to a traditional step instruction.</p>
